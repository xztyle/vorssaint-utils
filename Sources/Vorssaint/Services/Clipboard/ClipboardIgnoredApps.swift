/// after it happened, and by then the person may already be in the app they

/// the wrong app exactly in the case this list exists for, since the windows
/// that hold passwords usually close themselves the instant something is
/// copied.
///
/// So instead of one guess, every app that came to the front since the last
/// look is kept, and the copy is left out when any of them is on the list. The
/// window is under a second, and leaving out one copy too many is the harmless
/// side of being wrong here.

/// Nothing is watched while the list is empty, which is the normal case: no
/// notification is subscribed and every question is answered without work.
